![Cards](Cards.jpg)

## Goal

Goal of this experiment is to find out if there are strategies
that are easy and better.

Strategy|Description
---|---
C|Play cards that are common in hands of others (they are rare in player's hand nor in played pile) 
H|Always play the card with the highest value
R|Play randomly
L|Always play the card with the lowest value
U|Play cards that are uncommon/rare in hands of others (they are common in player's hand and in played pile) 

## Methods

  * Assign 2, 3, or 4 players with a fixed strategy, in all combinations
    of strategies
  * Play 1M games, score who wins

## Results

Whatever strategy, the first player has an advantage of
51%, 34.6% and 27.7% in 2, 3 and 4 player games respectively.

## Discussion

There may be smarter strategies, for example, those that
count cards.

## Short manual

### Cards

There are 36 cards, as there is a card for
each combination of one of the six colors and one of the six value.

### Setup

 * Each player gets 112 coins (1 x 50, 1 x 20, 2 x 10, 2 x 5, 4 x 2, 4 x 1)
 * Each player get five random cards
 * The other cards are put on drawing pile
 * Top card of drawing pile is put open on playing pile

## Playing

 * The active player must place any card on the playing
   pile that has either the same color or value. If
   the player does so, it is the next player's turn
 * If no card can be played, the active player must draw a card.
   If that card can be played, it is played. Then, it is
   the next player's turn.
 * Whoever gets rid of all cards wins the game
